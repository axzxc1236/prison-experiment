# Simulate 100 prisoners riddle

I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA) and I wanted to try.

In smart.py scenario, there are exactly 0 times where prisoner needs to choose random boxes to open, so the code were commented out, the strategy really works compare to randomly opening boxes.

In panic.py scenario, I didn't see any success.
